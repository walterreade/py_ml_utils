Distributed Model Finder:
- Define data sets
  - Numerical only
  - Categoricals only
  - Categoricals to index
  - One hot encoded
  - One hot encoded + numericals
  - Custom splits
    - i.e. One data set per country or other category before splitting into 
      above sets
- Create a definition (JSON) of all available classifiers/regressors with
  their limitiations and some basic configuration:
  - Supports sparse
  - Supports categoricals
  - Supports indexes
  - Needs one hot encoding
  - Base settings that differ results dramatically, like kernel is svm.  This
    can be a complex structure of settings ie. so for some kernels some settings
    not supported.  Perhaps another classifier defined for such large settings.
- Build all classifiers to be tested and put them in a queue with all 
  compatible datasets.
- Launch all engines to take items from queue and process a CV and return 
  results to hub. Errors also sent to hub
- Data not to be sent accross network but stored on each machines local data 
  dir.
- Hub to save results as they come in.
- User can then analyse results interactively
